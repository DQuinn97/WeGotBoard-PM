# WeGotBoard-PM
*!! Repo for project management tickets only !!*

## WeGotBoard Project guidelines:

***All issues/branches need to be created through Github Projects, do not create new issues/branches from one of the repos or external git managers. This creates ease of use with minimal mistakes and later cleanup.

### Repos:

Please use each repo for its appropriate use:
+ WeGotBoard-front for all client-side features, even if they make an API call to the admin-side
+ WeGotBoard-back for all admin-side only features (so the API and DB itself)
+ WeGotBoard-PM for all contributor issues related to Project Management (setting up repos, sprints, raw documentation, ...)

### Epics:

An **epic** describes multiple (larger) features that form one unit (like a full webpage).
The epic needs to be created on the appropriate repo.  
ch epic needs to be named `EPIC_<feature name>`.  
Each epic needs to be subdivided into sub-issues that each form one singular user-story.  

### User-Stories:

A **user-story** describes one singular feature in detail.  
Each story
